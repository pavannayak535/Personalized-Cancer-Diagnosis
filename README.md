# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis

## Description
A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated. Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). As not all mutations lead to cancer. Due to a mutation in a gene, there is some genetic variation developed in a gene. But the question comes, from which particular mutation this genetic variation happened in a gene. Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually which is a very time-consuming task. Based on a gene and a variation in it, a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

## Problem Statement
Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. In this problem, we need to find the mutation-type given the gene, variation and some text data from published research.
